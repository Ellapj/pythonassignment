Simple Calculator Program (Python)
📋 Project Overview
This Python program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—between two numbers. It prompts the user for input and prints the formatted result based on the chosen operation.

💻 How It Works
- The program asks the user to enter two numbers.
- It prompts for a math operation: +, -, *, or /.
- Based on the input, it performs the corresponding calculation.
- The result is displayed in the format: number1 operator number2 = result.
Example:
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +  
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
